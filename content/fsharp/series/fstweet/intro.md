Hi!

I'm really excited to share with you the new blog post series, Creating a Twitter Clone in F# using Suave. 

The core objective of this series is answering the one question.

How can I create a **production-ready real-world business application end to end** in F# using functional programming principles?

I believe F# is one of the elegant programming language that can help developers to deliver robust softwares and add value to the businesses. 

It kindles a new thought process, a better perspective for developing software products. 

In this series we will be starting from the scratch (right from creating an empty directory for the project) and incrementantly add business features one at a time and wrap up with deploying to Azure. 

Overall, It's going to be lot of fun! Let's start our journey.
